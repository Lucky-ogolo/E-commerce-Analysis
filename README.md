# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard** built in **Power BI** to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends across time, geography, and products.

The goal of the project was to practice **end-to-end Power BI workflow** — from data preparation and modeling to DAX calculations, visual design, and insight generation — using a realistic multi-table dataset.

> 🔍 This project was completed as a **guided learning project**, following a YouTube tutorial by **Freedom Oboh**, with additional customization, formatting, and structuring done independently to reinforce understanding.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The analysis uses **six related tables**:

- **Customer** – customer details and identifiers  
- **Item** – product information  
- **Fact** – central fact table for analysis  
- **Transaction** – transaction-level sales data  
- **Time** – date and time attributes  
- **Store** – 

These tables were modeled using proper relationships to support accurate analysis.

## 🧹 Data Preparation (Power Query)
All datasets were loaded into **Power Query**, where the following steps were performed:

- Cleaned and standardized column names  
- Merged case-sensitive duplicates  
- Promoted headers  
- Changed data types appropriately  
- Removed unnecessary columns  
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency  

This ensured the data was **analysis-ready** before loading into the Power BI model.

## 🧮 DAX Measures & Calculations
Several DAX measures were created to support the dashboard, including:

- Total Revenue  
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Average Unit Price  
- Total Customers  
- Previous Year (PY) metrics for all KPIs  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) % change for:
  - Revenue  
  - Quantity  
  - Average Unit Price  
  - Customers  

These measures enabled **time-based performance comparison** and trend analysis.

## 📈 Dashboard Features & Visuals
The dashboard was designed with a clean, professional layout using a **custom background created in PowerPoint** and exported into Power BI.

### Key Visuals Include:
- **Shape Map** for geographic sales distribution  
- **KPI Cards** for:
  - Revenue, Quantity, Avg Unit Price (with PY & YoY)
  - Total Customers (with PY & YoY)
- **Donut Chart** – Top 5 customers by total spending  
- **Area Chart** – Customer spending distribution  
- **Stacked Column Chart** – Total sales by month  
- **Line Chart** – Monthly sales trend  
- **Bar Charts**:
  - Top 5 countries by total sales  
  - Top 5 products by quantity sold  
- **Year Slicer** for interactive filtering across visuals
